    <p style="font-size: 24px;" >  The lion &#128005  is often referred to as the 
        king of the &#127806 jungle due to its imposing presence, 
        majestic appearance, and dominant position within its 
        ecosystem. As apex predators, lions are at the top of 
        the food chain, exhibiting unparalleled strength, strategic
         hunting skills, and social structure within their prides. 
         Their powerful roars, which can be heard up to five miles
          away, serve as a declaration of their territory and prowess.
           The lion's mane, unique among big cats &#128008,  symbolizes strength
            and virility, further enhancing its regal image. 
            Additionally, lions have been embedded in human culture 
            and mythology as symbols of courage, nobility, and 
            leadership &#128202, reinforcing their reputation as the
             king &#128081 of the jungle. </p>
