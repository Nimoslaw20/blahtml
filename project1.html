<h1>My Favorite Place in Texas</h1>

<h1>Houston</h1>

<p>
    Houston is a vibrant city known for its 
    diverse culture, delicious food, and thriving
     economy. It's home to NASA's Johnson Space Center, 
     the prestigious Texas Medical Center, and a plethora 
     of museums, parks, and attractions.

<h1> Recreation Center</h1>
<p>
    Hermann Park is one of the most popular 
    recreation centers in Houston. It offers a
     beautiful escape from the city with its lush 
     green spaces, walking trails, pedal boats,
      and the renowned Houston Zoo. Visitors can
       also enjoy cultural events and performances
        at the Miller Outdoor Theatre located within
         the park.
